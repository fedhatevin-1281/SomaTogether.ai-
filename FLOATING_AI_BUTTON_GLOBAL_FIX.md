# ðŸ¤– Global Floating AI Button Fix

## Problem
The Floating AI Mascot button was only appearing in the TeacherDashboard component, but it should be visible on every page for teachers and parents after login.

## Solution âœ…

### 1. **Added Global Import**
- Added `FloatingAIButton` import to `src/App.tsx`

### 2. **Added Global Rendering**
- Added the FloatingAIButton to the main App layout
- Conditionally rendered for teachers and parents only:
```tsx
{/* Global Floating AI Button for Teachers and Parents */}
{(currentRole === 'teacher' || currentRole === 'parent') && <FloatingAIButton />}
```

### 3. **Removed Duplicate from TeacherDashboard**
- Removed `FloatingAIButton` import from `src/components/teacher/TeacherDashboard.tsx`
- Removed the FloatingAIButton JSX element from TeacherDashboard component

## ðŸŽ¯ Result

The Floating AI Mascot button now appears:
- âœ… **On every page** for teachers (dashboard, profile, requests, assignments, etc.)
- âœ… **On every page** for parents (dashboard, child progress, teacher overview, etc.)
- âœ… **Not visible** for students (as intended)
- âœ… **Not visible** on login/onboarding screens
- âœ… **Fixed position** in bottom-right corner with proper z-index
