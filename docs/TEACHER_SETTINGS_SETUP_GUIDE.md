# Teacher Settings System Setup Guide

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for setting up the Teacher Settings system for SomaTogether.ai. The system includes profile management, document uploads, preferences configuration, and skill management.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema Setup

### Step 1: Run the Schema Script

Execute the `teacher-settings-schema.sql` file in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Copy and paste the entire content of teacher-settings-schema.sql
-- This will create all necessary tables, functions, and policies
```

### Step 2: Verify Schema Creation

Run these verification queries to ensure everything was created correctly:

```sql
-- Check if all tables exist
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN (
  'teacher_documents', 'teacher_preferences', 'teacher_subjects', 
  'teacher_skills', 'teacher_schedule_templates', 'teacher_time_off', 'teacher_metrics'
);

-- Check if functions exist
SELECT routine_name 
FROM information_schema.routines 
WHERE routine_schema = 'public' 
AND routine_name IN (
  'create_teacher_preferences', 'update_teacher_profile', 
  'get_teacher_dashboard_data', 'upload_teacher_document'
);

-- Check teacher table enhancements
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'teachers' 
AND column_name IN (
  'profile_image_url', 'cover_image_url', 'teaching_philosophy', 
  'certifications', 'languages', 'social_links', 'timezone', 'notification_preferences'
);
```

## üìÅ Storage Setup

### Step 3: Create Storage Bucket

Create a new storage bucket for teacher documents:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Storage
2. Click "New Bucket"
3. Name: `teacher-documents`
4. Make it public: `true`
5. File size limit: `50MB`
6. Allowed MIME types: `image/*, application/pdf`

### Step 4: Configure Storage Policies

Run these policies to allow teachers to upload and manage their documents:

```sql
-- Allow teachers to upload their own documents
CREATE POLICY "Teachers can upload own documents" ON storage.objects
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
    bucket_id = 'teacher-documents' AND
    auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  );

-- Allow teachers to view their own documents
CREATE POLICY "Teachers can view own documents" ON storage.objects
  FOR SELECT USING (
    bucket_id = 'teacher-documents' AND
    auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  );

-- Allow teachers to update their own documents
CREATE POLICY "Teachers can update own documents" ON storage.objects
  FOR UPDATE USING (
    bucket_id = 'teacher-documents' AND
    auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  );

-- Allow teachers to delete their own documents
CREATE POLICY "Teachers can delete own documents" ON storage.objects
  FOR DELETE USING (
    bucket_id = 'teacher-documents' AND
    auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  );
```

## üéØ Frontend Integration

### Step 5: Add Settings to Teacher Dashboard

Update your teacher dashboard to include the settings component:

```tsx
// In your teacher dashboard component
import { TeacherSettings } from '../components/teacher/TeacherSettings';

// Add to your navigation or routing
<Route path="/teacher/settings" element={<TeacherSettings />} />
```

### Step 6: Update Navigation

Add settings link to your teacher navigation:

```tsx
// Example navigation item
<NavItem href="/teacher/settings">
  <Settings className="h-4 w-4" />
  Settings
</NavItem>
```

## üîß Component Usage

### Basic Usage

```tsx
import { TeacherSettings } from '../components/teacher/TeacherSettings';
import { useAuth } from '../contexts/AuthContext';

function TeacherDashboard() {
  const { user } = useAuth();
  
  if (!user) return <div>Please log in</div>;
  
  return (
    <div>
      <TeacherSettings />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Using the Hook

```tsx
import { useTeacherSettings } from '../hooks/useTeacherSettings';

function CustomTeacherComponent() {
  const {
    profile,
    preferences,
    loading,
    updateProfile,
    uploadDocument
  } = useTeacherSettings(userId);
  
  // Use the data and functions
}
```
